**MPC Project**

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/896/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### The Model
#### 1.Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.


### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
#### 1.Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
#### 1.A polynomial is fitted to waypoints.
#### 2.If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

### Model Predictive Control with Latency
#### 1.The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.
